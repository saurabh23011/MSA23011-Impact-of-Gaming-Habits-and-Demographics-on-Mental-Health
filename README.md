# Gaming Habits and Mental Health Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between gaming habits, demographics, and mental health outcomes using machine learning approaches. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset from the Open Source Framework (OSF) containing information about gamers' psychological metrics and demographic data.

## Key Features
- Analyzes three mental health indicators:
  - General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
  - Satisfaction with Life (SWL)
  - Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN)
- Implements two machine learning models:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with polynomial kernel
- Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Includes custom evaluation metrics for multi-class classification

## Data Processing
- Initial dataset: 13,464 rows Ã— 55 columns
- Cleaned and preprocessed data by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding
- Reduced dimensions using PCA while preserving data integrity

## Model Performance
### Random Forest
- Best performing model with 35% accuracy on GAD_T
- Average distance from true class: 2.58 (compared to random guess of 20.7)
- 86.30% of predictions within 2 classes of true GAD_T score

### SVM
- Improved using OneVsRestClassifier approach
- Performance after optimization:
  - GAD_T: 24.71%
  - SWL_T: 13.50%
  - SPIN_T: 7.48%
- Average distance from true class: 5.52

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
- Incorporate rank standardization across different games
- Analyze correlation between rank and stress levels
- Study the transition from casual to competitive gaming
- Investigate relationship between gaming skill ceiling and stress indicators
